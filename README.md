# Chris Seitz, Full-stack DevSecOps
## Full-Stack Project

The goal of this project is to use pretty much everything in existence to create all infastructure that I could ever be needed to do.

The running list of what this project will consist of is:
- Node.js
- MongoDB for unstructured storage
- Redis for caching all other databases
- Vue, React, Angular (Each frontend coded 3 times in each framework)
- Docker Containers & Scaling
- NGINX
- Progressive Web Apps
- Travis CI
- Git (like, push git to its limits and master it)
- Load Balancing
- Graphing and Data Analytics
- Security
- AssemblyScript & WebAssembly
